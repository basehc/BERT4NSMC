# BERT for Nucleotide Sequences of Microbial Communities

This is a project that uses BERT, a pre-trained model based on the transformer architecture, to encode and analyze nucleotide sequences of microbial communities. The goal is to leverage the power of natural language processing to provide effective feature extraction schemes for microbial sequence identification and virus host classification.
