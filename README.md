# BERT for Nucleotide Sequences of Microbial Communities

This is a project that uses BERT, a large language model based on the transformer architecture, to encode and analyze nucleotide sequences of microbial communities. The goal is to leverage the power of natural language processing to understand the structure and function of microbial genomes and metagenomes.
